Section 2 README, BRIAN HUDICK
-majority of the work for grabbing cards is being done via card.lua as opposed to main. the main thing being 
 done through main is making sure the selected card appears on top when grabbed
-majority of the code for frame updated functions is stored in its own function either in main.lua or card.lua, 
 but almost all functionality for code I know is only going to get used once is built inside the load() function in 
 main.lua
-the code inside graber and card are more or less straightforward, it's the logic for setting up the cards 
 and updating the grabber class that gets a bit messy
-if I could figure out how to cache the selected card into the grabber class without causing errors, it'd 
 make it a little cleaner
-I'm currently using the update pattern because input and card movement needs to be polled overtime, the 
 singleton pattern is in effect for the card_list that stores all instances of the cards as well as table 
 deck which stores the deck pile, state pattern is being used to track which card is being grabbed, finally 
 I'm using the flyweight class to store the draw data for each card inside each card instance
