-Marcus Ochoa: 
	-saw that I saw using a "medium class" to create subclass inheritance 
         for the player and AI subclasses, suggested that I get rework it by creating
         a blank player base class and add on to it
         
        -what I did: I reworked the code so that it uses true inheritance as opposed to
         the pseudo inheritance I was doing via a medium pseudo class which in all honesty
         I barely knew how it worked

Its a tenet of good observer discipline that two observers observing the same subject should have no _ relative to each other
